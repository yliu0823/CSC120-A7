Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the constructor, because in this way, we don't need to use the full constructor each time when building a new object and we can also set some default values for the constructor of each class. I also overloaded the goUp and goDown method for library class because it may be useful for people who visiting the library to use go up or go down methods.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Most things worked for this assignment, but I didn't figured out a way to make the campus map interactive. I would advice someone taking this course in the future to understand the difference between overriding and overloading before working on the assignment.
